          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <p>With present day technology, there is the demand to view web pages on various types of devices. Previously, web pages were only able to be accessed on desktops or laptops. Moving forward, new devices such as tablets and smart phones were released. This created the demand for programmers to be able to adjust web pages for these devices through responsive design. This meant that the web page would be adjusted according to the screen size. If you were to shrink the size of the screen, then the content should still fit whatever size it was adjusted to. This allowed for users to still enjoy the content of a web site regardless of what device they chose to view it on without sacrificing too much quality. This allows companies to generate more revenue since they can reach a broader audience.</p>
          <p>In this final assignment, I used the designs from assignment 5 and 6 to present my storefront. To adjust the screen for a smaller size, I used the “@media rule” and media queries to apply these changes. I adjusted the screen size to 600px for these changes to be made. In the media queries, I adjusted the containers “.ourohead, nav, main, .item, .rpanel” to a width of 100% so that they stack on top of each other when viewed on a smaller screen. I also made sure to set the width and height of the images to 100px so that they display one at a time and stacked on the smaller screen.</p>
          <p>I learnt that when designing a web page, you must consider how your audience would view your page. I am also aware that if a web page is complex, you may have to sacrifice certain aspects of the web page so that it is accessible on a mobile device.</p>
